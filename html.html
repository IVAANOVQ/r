<h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
    <li>6 fresh Anaheim chile peppers</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) package queso asadero (white Mexican cheese), cut into 3/4-inch thick strips</li>
    <li>2 large eggs, separated </li>
    <li> 1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li> ¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 cup vegetable shortening for frying</li>


</ul>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>
    Preheat the oven broiler; set the oven rack about 6 inches below the heat source.
    Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
</p>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>
    Place peppers onto the prepared baking sheet and broil until skins are blackened and blistered, about 10 minutes.<br>
    Use tongs to rotate peppers often to char all sides. Place blackened peppers into a bowl and tightly seal with plastic wrap. Allow peppers to steam as they cool, about 15 minutes.
</p>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>
    Remove skin from peppers, then cut a slit down the long side of each one to remove seeds and core.<br> Rinse peppers inside and out and pat dry with paper towels.
    Stuff peppers with strips of cheese.
</p>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>
    Whisk egg yolks and baking powder in a bowl until combined.<br>
    Beat egg whites with an electric mixer in a separate bowl until stiff peaks form.<br>
    Gently fold beaten whites into the yolk mixture. Place flour into a separate shallow bowl.

</p>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>
    Melt vegetable shortening in a skillet over medium heat. Roll each stuffed pepper in flour, tap off excess flour, and dip into the egg mixture to coat both sides.<br> Gently lay coated peppers into the hot shortening.
    Fry peppers until lightly golden brown and cheese has melted, about 5 minutes per side.

    Colorado Green Chili (Chile Verde)

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 ½ pounds cubed pork stew meat</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste </li>
    <li> 1 large yellow onion, diced</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 cups chopped, roasted green chiles</li>
    <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups tomatillo salsa</li>
    <li>5 cups chicken broth</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>1 pinch ground cloves</li>


</ul>
</p>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>
    Heat the olive oil in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium-high heat.
    Season the pork with salt and pepper to taste, then place into the hot oil.<br> Cook until golden brown on all sides, about 7 minutes. Once browned, remove the pork and set aside. Reduce heat to medium, and stir in the onion and garlic.<br> Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
</p>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>
    Return the pork to the pot, and stir in the green chiles, diced tomatoes with juice, tomatillo salsa, and chicken broth. Season with oregano and clove.<br> Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 20 minutes.
</p>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>
    After 20 minutes, remove 2 cups of the soup (ensure there are no pork cubes in it), and pour into a blender. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree until smooth, then pour back into the cooking pot. This will create a thicker texture for your chili and will eliminate some of the chunky bits of chiles. Continue to simmer, stirring occasionally until the pork is very tender, at least 35 minutes more.
